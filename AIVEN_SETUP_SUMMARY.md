## 📋 Your Aiven Credentials

Based on your screenshot:

```
Host: your-aiven-host.aivencloud.com
Port: your-port
User: avnadmin
Password: your-database-password
Database: defaultdb
SSL Mode: REQUIRED
```

## 🚀 Next Steps - Choose Your Path

### Path A: Quick Automated Setup (Recommended)

1. **Download CA Certificate** from Aiven dashboard
   - Click "Show" next to "CA certificate"
   - Download the certificate file

2. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   node setup_aiven.js
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts** and you're done!

### Path B: Manual Setup

1. **Create certificate directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir server/certs
   ```

2. **Save your ca.pem file:**
   - Download from Aiven
   - Save to `server/certs/ca.pem`

3. **Create server/.env file:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Edit server/.env** with your credentials (they're already in .env.example!)

5. **Test connection:**
   ```bash
   node test_aiven_connection.js
   ```

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### Test 1: Connection Test
```bash
cd server
node test_aiven_connection.js
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Connection established successfully!
✅ Ping successful!
🎉 SUCCESS! Your Aiven database is ready to use!
```

### Test 2: Initialize Database
```bash
cd server
node test_database.js
```

This will:
- Create all tables
- Insert default data
- Run comprehensive tests

### Test 3: Start Server
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

Look for:
```
✅ SSL certificate loaded from file
✅ Database connection successful
🚀 Shooting Range Dashboard Server running on port 3001
```

## 🌐 Deploying to Vercel

### Step 1: Convert Certificate
```bash
cd server
node convert_cert_to_base64.js certs/ca.pem
```

Copy the output (base64 string).

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables in Vercel

Go to: **Vercel Dashboard** → **Your Project** → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**

Add these variables:

```
DB_HOST=your-aiven-host.aivencloud.com
DB_PORT=your-port
DB_USER=avnadmin
DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
DB_NAME=defaultdb
DB_SSL=true
DB_CA_CERT=<paste your base64 certificate here>
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=<generate a secure random string>
SESSION_SECRET=<generate a secure random string>
```

### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## 📁 Where to Put the CA Certificate

### For Local Development:
```
server/certs/ca.pem
```

This file should:
- ✅ Be downloaded from Aiven dashboard
- ✅ Be saved in `server/certs/` directory
- ✅ Be referenced in `.env` as `DB_CA_CERT_PATH=server/certs/ca.pem`
- ❌ Never be committed to Git (already in .gitignore)

### For Vercel Deployment:
The certificate should be:
- ✅ Converted to base64 using `convert_cert_to_base64.js`
- ✅ Added as `DB_CA_CERT` environment variable in Vercel
- ✅ The base64 string should be the entire certificate content

## 🔒 Security Notes

### What's Protected:
- ✅ `server/certs/` directory is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ `server/.env` is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ `*.pem` files are in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Base64 certificate files are in `.gitignore`

### What You Should Do:
- ✅ Never commit `.env` files
- ✅ Never commit certificate files
- ✅ Use different credentials for production
- ✅ Rotate passwords regularly
- ✅ Use strong JWT and session secrets

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Certificate file not found"
```bash
# Check if file exists
ls server/certs/ca.pem

# If not, download from Aiven and save it there
```

### "Connection timeout"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify host and port in `.env`
- Check Aiven firewall settings (allow your IP)

### "SSL connection error"
- Ensure `DB_SSL=true` in `.env`
- Verify certificate is valid
- Try re-downloading from Aiven

### "Access denied"
- Double-check username and password
- Verify database name is `defaultdb`
