## 🎯 Your Aiven Credentials (Pre-configured)

All helper scripts and documentation already include your credentials:

```
Host:     your-aiven-host.aivencloud.com
Port:     your-port
User:     avnadmin
Password: your-database-password
Database: defaultdb
SSL:      REQUIRED
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps - What YOU Need to Do

### Step 1: Download CA Certificate (1 minute)

1. Go to your Aiven dashboard
2. Click on your MySQL database
3. Find "CA certificate" section
4. Click "Show" or "Download"
5. Save the file as `ca.pem`

### Step 2: Run Setup Script (2 minutes)

```bash
cd server
node setup_aiven.js
```

Follow the prompts - the script will:
- Ask where you saved `ca.pem`
- Create your `.env` file
- Test the connection
- Tell you what to do next

### Step 3: Initialize Database (2 minutes)

```bash
node test_database.js
```

This creates all tables and inserts default data.

### Step 4: Start Development

```bash
npm start
```

**That's it!** Your app is now connected to Aiven MySQL! 🎉
